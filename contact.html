			<h2>M.Sai Latish </h2>
			<p>I’m Sai Latish. I saw everything in pictures. Framing things out, just wishing I had a camera on me to take a photograph before the scene so quickly faded away. Years later, the dream of owning my own “big” camera came true. I wore that thing out chasing butterflies in my front yard, determined to snap a good one, and convincing all of my friends to model for “photo shoots.” Behind the camera was my happy place. It was like I could reach out, grab and hold forever the moments that were in front of me. In the beginning I knew I wasn’t good, but unlike anything else in life…I didn’t care. I loved it too much. I knew with time and patience, I would grow. So, this little plant got out in the sun. Anytime I could, I was shooting, being watered by photographers who will always hold a special place in my heart. It was the summer of 2011 that I saw my first flower begin to bud. What hope that brought to my heart! I understood that I served The Creator of creativity itself, and so, in trusting The Lord to carry me through, He did. So, here I am, living my childhood dream, white picket fence and all. I cherish the simple things in life; a warm summer day, making sun tea while my pretty pup Presley runs laps around the acorn tree in our backyard. More than anything, photography is a priceless treasure in life, and one that I can’t imagine living a day without. How quickly the years go by, and to be able to relive ages and stages time and time again is but a dream. Whether he just got down on one knee, and you’re looking to have your sweet love captured in the most genuine way, or you just found out that there is a little baby in your belly, I would truly be honored to be the one to document your life’s most special moments. With over 230 portrait sessions and 60 weddings behind me, I move forward with great expectation that the best is yet to come. I am thrilled that you are here, considering me as your photographer.
